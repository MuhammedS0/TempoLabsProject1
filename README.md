Taking design patterns and converting them to react components
So, I was dealing with the a Porfolio design concept. the design had a components section. I just tried to take each component section and create a react component out of it.
Some things to consider --> 1. Design was build using React and CSS, looking to use Tailwind moving forward. 2. Some designs are not as accurate as I would like.
3. I am in the process of using cursor and copycoder to find tune the design. I will also try to use these two tools to build the complete website
