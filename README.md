Taking design patterns and converting them to react components
So, I was dealing with the a Porfolio design concept. the design had a components section. I just tried to take each component section and create a react component out of it.
Some things to consider --> 1. Design was build using React and CSS, looking to use Tailwind moving forward. 2. Some designs are not as accurate as I would like + some I have not started. I will mention them below.
  1. Background design (3 butterfies)
  2. horizontal skills diplay component
  3. small cards components with arrow button on the side
  4. Picture of person (on landing page) component
5. I am also process of using cursor and copycoder to find tune the design. I will also try to use these two tools to build the complete version of the website.
